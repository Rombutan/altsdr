# altsdr
An altoid tin sized sdr for hams

The idea behind this is to fill the gap between commercial radios, sdr and otherwise, that are forbiddingly expensive and do not provide useful repair or modification guides. And relatively cheap sdr's like the hackrf, limesdr, and others which while being great for hacking around, don't have enough output power to be useful for hams and *must* be used with a computer.


The altsdr will have:

1. 1 to 3 watt output
2. built in display and interface
3. open source hardware and software
4. 100khz rf bandwidth with built in processor
5. 20khz transmit bandwidth
6. voice modes and popular digital modes such as ft8, jt65, aprs etc.
7. 1 to 200mhz base frequency range
8. expandable transmit and receive performance with modular daughter-boards
9. a small built in battery good for a few hours
10. a built in solar charger (no panels) for said battery
11. 10 to 30 volt input with fusing and ovp
12. three rf ports, each software routable to receive or transmit and configurable to switch automatically.

*in construction*
