# altsdr
An altoid tin sized sdr for hams

The idea behind this is to full the gap between comercial radios, sdr and otherwise that are forbiddingly expensive and do not provide usefull repair or modification guides. And relatively cheap sdr's like hte hackrf, limesdr, and others which while being great for hacking around, don't have enough output power to be usefull for hams and *must* be used with a computer.


The altsdr will have:

1. 1 to 3 watt output
2. built in display and interface
3. open source hardware and software
4. 100khz rf bandwidth with built in processor
5. 20khz transmit bandwidth
6. voice modes and popular digital modes such as ft8, jt65, aprs etc.
7. 1 to 200mhz base badwidth
8. expandable transmit and recieve performance with modular daughterboards
9. a small built in battery good for a few hours
10. a built in solar charger (no panels) for said battery
11. 10 to 30 volt input with fusing and ovp
12. three rf ports, each software routable to recieve or transmitt and configuarble to switch automatically.
 

*Instructions will be here in the future*
